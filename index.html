	<h1>About Me</h1>

		<img src="assets/images/dsc1315.jpg">

	<p>I am an inexperienced developer, but a skilled problem solver. Using logic and a quick mind, I will be able to overcome any odds that are thrown at me for your project. Rest assured that your project will receive the full attention it deserves in order to build a fully-functional and intricate, yet easy-to-navigate website.</p>

	<p>My background is in jewelry manufacturing. In my spare time, I also co-own and manage a Kosher Vegetarian Chinese restaurant named Buddha Bodai, located at 5 Mott Street in Chinatown, NYC. </p>
